                This startup had reached an outstanding increase in terms of the number of contracts with schools in more than 212 cities in Iran during the covid 19 outbreak. Due to the fast pace growth of the company focused mostly on sales, the scale up of the company divisions specially technical, financial and marketing department faced various challenges and barriers. I loved the value they created for students thus decided to hop on and helped with the following matters in the past few months (50 hours/month) to help them as far as I can and have learned from my past journey:
<ul> 
<li>Creating and running a financial department and defining all required processes in a limited one month period all of which was outsourced to a company priorly. </li>
<li>Re-definition and realigning company vision, core values, brand entity, and strategic priorities.</li>
<li>Management of the tight scheduled team building and setting up a cohesive, well-structured technical team through right hires and decisive planning for tackling problems and challenges.</li> 
</ul>

              <p>
                The entire team of Carpino (top 3 ride-hailing service in Iran at that time) was intended to be replaced with the one I was a member of since Aqiq Telecom in a 6 month period due to prior complications between the founders and investors of this company. Due to the complexities and challenges of handing over the technical infrastructure to the new CTO of Carpino, I was designated with the mission to create a parallel team to the core technical team. The goal defined for our team was developing and launching fast to market products with minimum requirements and dependency on the core technical team. 
In this team we:
                <ul> 
                  <li> Re-designed and launched Carpino's new website in a limited time span of two months.  </li>
                  <li>- Re-designed the user interface and experience of the official application alongside the core tech and product team.</li>
                  <li>- Launched effective products in the one year time span mostly focused on helping the Marketing and BI team meet their goals of increasing rides 10 times in a 6 month period including a product similar to Lyft and Uber pass based on history and cluster of customers. This product was the first in the industry which was followed up by competitors (Tap30) and helped increase daily number of rides in rush hours more than 35% monthly. </li>

          <h2 class="mb-5">About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I come from a family with academic background. My father was a PhD student in Manchester, UK back in the 90s, so I had the privilege of having access to a computer at an early age. I wrote my first software using C++ back in 1999. I assume my future path and career in the startup and tech ecosystem wasn't coincidental after all. I studied IT Engineering both for my bachelors and masters and got to work for a couple of years with C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. Later, I lost my enthusiasm for code and probably for the same reason I chose a management path down the line. I liked the people side more honestly! 

At 21, I had my first try at building a business with a group of university friends. It led to a website for swapping university books. It eventually became my first failure! 

Summer 2015, I accidently got introduced to individuals who later became my co-founders down the line. They owned a travel agency and intended to provide tourism services online. Having no sufficient capital, I made a calculated risk and decided to hop on free of charge, and built the first working version in 2 months with the help of a university friend Reza Karimi (Thanks bro!) in return for a share in the travel agency. I coded the front-end with bootstrap and JavaScript and it went live, showed massive traction, and Vistavel was born! Vistavel went to become one of the top choices for users seeking travel insurance, luxury travel services, and VIP bus tickets reaching top 5 sellers for the well-known suppliers of our services. 

My Second experience with building a startup, hiring, bootstrapping, managing and overcoming hurdles in Vistavel ended upon my exit back in 2019. The startup failed to scale after my exit due to lack of raising sufficient funds on time! Nevertheless, it had a significant impact on my future path leading to product management, and executive roles in well-known startups in Iran later down the road. I've experienced various industries including: 
- Tourism, 
- Ride-hailing, 
- Fintech,
- EdTech
- FMCG

I can help startups prepare better for scale up! So, let's schedule to meet and see how I can onboard.
